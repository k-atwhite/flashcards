# FlashCards

## Abstract
Do you need to brush up on your programming vocabulary? Do you love working in the command line?
Look no further! This project gave me the opportunity to start writing my own tests and
practicing Test Driven Development.

## Technologies Used
This app is built exclusively with javaScript and tested using Mocha framework and Chai
assertion library.

## Install/Setup instructions
Playing with these flashcards is simple. After cloning down this repo, make sure you are in the
root directory and run `node index.js`. After you finish answering all the cards in the deck, 
you will be shown your accuracy rate!

You will see the first question populate and three potential answers. You can choose your answer
with your arrow keypad or by typing in the corresponding number and pressing enter. Pressing enter
again will populate the next question.
